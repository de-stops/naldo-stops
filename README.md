# naldo-stops

This is a simple script to download all [naldo](https://www.naldo.de) stops as [GTFS-compatible CSV](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/stops-file).

The script uses the following endpoint:

```
http://efa2.naldo.de/naldo/XSLT_COORD_REQUEST?&jsonp=&boundingBox=&boundingBoxLU={minx}%3A{miny}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&boundingBoxRL={maxx}%3A{maxy}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&coordOutputFormat=WGS84%5BGGZHTXX%5D&type_1=STOP&outputFormat=json&inclFilter=1
```

It starts from bounding box `(5, 47, 15, 56)` and works down to smaller quadrants.

The script produces CSV output in the following format:

```
"stop_id","stop_name","stop_lon","stop_lat","stop_code"
"8030016","Gruol, Stunzachstraﬂe",8.7751465025,48.3448793463,"de:8417:30016"
```

# Usage

```
npm install
node index.js
```
